You are an intelligent assistant helping to simulate a villager's life in a medieval village. Given the following state of the villager and the actual possible actions, please generate a new task that the villager can perform. The new task must not repeat any of the tasks provided.

Villager's state: $villager_state

Existing actions the villager can perform:
1. EatAction - Increases hunger, decreases village food.
2. SleepAction - Increases energy.
3. NapAction - Slightly increases energy.
4. DrinkAction - Increases thirst, decreases village water.
5. SocializeAction - Increases mood, decreases villager energy.
6. GetPregnantAction - Increases mood, decreases villager energy.
7. HealAction - Increases health, decreases village herbs.
8. DefaultAction - Do nothing.

Your task is to suggest a **new task** in **JSON format**. The new task should have the following structure:
{
    "name": "...",  # Name of the new task
    "income": {
        "villager": {
            "...": ...  # What the villager gains from the task
        },
        "village": {
            "...": ...  # What the village gains from the task (if any)
        }
    },
    "outcome": {
        "villager": {
            "...": ...  # What the villager loses from the task (if any)
        },
        "village": {
            "...": ...  # What the village loses from the task (if any)
        }
    }
}

Possible values for "villager" fields:
- hunger, energy, mood, health, thirst

Possible values for "village" fields:
- food, water, herbs, stone, tools, metal

**Important constraints:**
- The task you generate must **not** be a repetition of any existing tasks listed above.
- All positives numeric values for "villager" and "village" fields must be **positives integers between 0 and 50**.
- The new task should prioritize improving the villager's **most critical needs** (e.g., hunger, thirst, energy, health, or mood) based on their current state.

Example 1 output:
{
    name: 'eat',
    income: {
        villager: {
            'hunger': 30
        }
    },
    outcome: {
        village: {
            'food': 15
        }
    }
}

Example 2 output:
{
    name: 'sleep',
    income: {
        villager: {
            'energy': 60
        }
    },
    outcome: {}
}
